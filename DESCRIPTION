Description: The difR package contains several methods to detect DIF in dichotomous and polytomous scored items. Both uniform and non-uniform DIF effects can be detected, using approaches that either rely on item response theory models or not. Some methods can handle more than one focal group. See Magis, Beland, Tuerlinckx, and De Boeck (2010, Behavior Research Methods, 42, 847â€“862, <doi:10.3758/BRM.42.3.847>) for a general overview.
